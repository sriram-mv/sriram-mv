# Hi there, I’m Sriram Madapusi Vasudevan 👋

I’m a Senior Engineer at AWS focused on building **agent-ready developer experiences**. 
I was part of the founding team and currently lead the dataplane team on [AWS DevOps Agent](https://aws.amazon.com/devops-agent/)

Over the past decade, I’ve worked on large-scale platforms and open-source tooling:

- AWS SAM CLI  
- AWS Lambda Builders  
- AWS Homebrew Tap  
- AWS CloudWatch  
- Rackspace Cloud Queues  (Openstack Zaqar)
- Rackspace Cloud CDN  (Openstack Poppy)

I’m language-agnostic and delight in building short feedback loops that evoke emotion.
